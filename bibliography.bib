abstract="Resolution of complex repeat structures and rearrangements in the assembly and analysis of large eukaryotic genomes is often aided by a combination of high-throughput sequencing and genome-mapping technologies (for example, optical restriction mapping). In particular, mapping technologies can generate sparse maps of large DNA fragments (150 kilo base pairs (kbp) to 2 Mbp) and thus provide a unique source of information for disambiguating complex rearrangements in cancer genomes. Despite their utility, combining high-throughput sequencing and mapping technologies has been challenging because of the lack of efficient and sensitive map-alignment algorithms for robustly aligning error-prone maps to sequences.",

abstract ={Motivation: Optical mapping is a technique for capturing fluorescent signal patterns of long DNAmolecules (in the range of 0.1 Mbp to 1 Mbp). Recently, it has been complementing the widely-used short-read sequencing technology by assisting with scaffolding and detecting large and complex structural variations. Here, we introduce a fast, robust and accurate tool called OMBlast for aligning optical maps, the set of signal locations on the molecules generated from optical mapping. Our method is based on the seed-and-extend approach from sequence alignment, with modifications specific to optical mapping.Results: Experiments with both synthetic and our real data demonstrate that OMBlast has higher accuracy and faster mapping speed than existing alignment methods. Our tool also shows significant improvement when aligning data with structural variations.Availability and Implementation: OMBlast is implemented for Java 1.7 and is released under a GPL license. OMBlast can be downloaded from https://github.com/aldenleung/OMBlast and run directly on machines equipped with a Java virtual machine.Contact: kevinyip@cse.cuhk.edu.hk; tf.chan@cuhk.edu.hkSupplementary Information: Supplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online and the source code is available from the OMBlast website (https://github.com/aldenleung/OMBlast).},

abstract ={Motivation: The Optical Mapping System discovers structural variants and potentiates sequence assembly of genomes via scaffolding and comparisons that globally validate or correct sequence assemblies. Despite its utility, there are few publicly available tools for aligning optical mapping datasets.Results: Here we present software, named ‘Maligner’, for the alignment of both single molecule restriction maps (Rmaps) and in silico restriction maps of sequence contigs to a reference. Maligner provides two modes of alignment: an efficient, sensitive dynamic programming implementation that scales to large eukaryotic genomes, and a faster indexed based implementation for finding alignments with unmatched sites in the reference but not the query. We compare our software to other publicly available tools on Rmap datasets and show that Maligner finds more correct alignments in comparable runtime. Lastly, we introduce the M-Score statistic for normalizing alignment scores across restriction maps and demonstrate its utility for selecting high quality alignments.Availability and implementation: The Maligner software is written in C ++ and is available at https://github.com/LeeMendelowitz/maligner under the GNU General Public License.Contact: mpop@umiacs.umd.edu},
